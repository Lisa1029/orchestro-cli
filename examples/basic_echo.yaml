name: Basic Echo Test
description: |
  Simplest possible Orchestro test - demonstrates basic command execution
  and output validation without any interactive elements.

  This example shows:
  - Running a simple shell command
  - Using expect to wait for output patterns
  - Basic timeout configuration

command: echo "Hello from Orchestro CLI!"
timeout: 5

steps:
  # Wait for the echo output
  - expect: "Hello from Orchestro"
    timeout: 2
    note: "Waiting for echo output..."

  # Alternative: match the full output with regex
  - expect: "Hello from Orchestro CLI!"
    timeout: 1
    note: "Validating complete output..."

# Note: This simple example has no file validations
# since echo just writes to stdout
validations: []
