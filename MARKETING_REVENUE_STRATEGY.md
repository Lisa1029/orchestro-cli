## 📢 Part 1: Zero-Budget Marketing Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch Week (Week 1) - Maximum Impact

#### Day 1: Hacker News (Primary Channel) 🔥

**Why**: Hacker News is THE platform for CLI dev tools
- Technical audience (developers)
- Show HN posts regularly hit front page
- One successful launch generated **107 points, 61k visitors, 50+ GitHub stars**
- VCs and startup veterans actively browse

**Execution**:
```
Title: "Show HN: Orchestro – Playwright for Terminal Applications"

Post:
Hey HN! I built Orchestro, an open-source testing framework for CLI/TUI apps.

Problem: Testing terminal apps is painful. No good tools exist for automated CLI/TUI testing with visual validation.

Solution: Orchestro provides:
• Screenshot-driven validation (like Playwright for terminals)
• Parallel execution (5.25x speedup with 8 workers)
• REST/GraphQL API for CI/CD integration
• Intelligence-assisted test generation (AST analysis)
• Works with Textual, Rich, curses apps

Tech: Python, FastAPI, pexpect, AsyncIO
License: MIT
Repo: github.com/vyb/orchestro-cli

Would love feedback from anyone testing CLI tools!
```

**Best Practices**:
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am PST (peak engagement)
- Link directly to GitHub repo
- Respond to ALL comments within first 2 hours
- Have demo GIF/video ready
- Include "Show HN:" prefix

**Expected Results**:
- 50-200+ GitHub stars
- 20-50k website visitors
- 500-1,000 developer signups
- 10-20 high-quality feedback threads

#### Day 2: Product Hunt

**Title**: "Orchestro - Playwright for Terminal Applications"
